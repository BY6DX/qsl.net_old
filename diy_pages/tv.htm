<P>Simple television receiver.. ..tvphk.gif<BR>
  <IMG height=155 hspace=6 
src="tv.files/tvphk.gif" width=192 align=left> When I made FM radio, I could hear 
  the voice signal of first channel of TV. On the frequency slightly lower than 
  that, I could hear the noisy signal of picture of TV. My oscilloscope has Z 
  input. It can display black and white. I made the simple TV receiver. It displays 
  the picture on my oscilloscope.<BR>
  See fig 1! The signal (comming from the antenna) is amplified and detected. 
  It has the same circuit as a FM radio. But detector of it is amplitude modulation 
  detector. This radio do not have tune control. This machine is able to receiv 
  only the first channel. Receiving frequency is tuned by core of T3. On the (A) 
  point of fig2, I can watch the TV signal indicated on the textbook. See fig 
  3! I show you the (A) point signal. (A) point signal includes picture signal 
  and horizontal synchronous signal and vertical synchronous signal. Each signals 
  are separated by the signal separator. The famous oscillator IC (555) products 
  the vertical sweep signal. And it is synchronized by the separated synchronous 
  trigger signal. Z input of oscilloscope indicates only black or white. It can 
  not display the gray. It is TTL level input. Therefore the picture on the oscilloscope 
  is only yes or no. It can indicates only the outline of the picture. The Brown 
  tube of oscilloscope is not so bright as that of sold TV set. So I must look 
  it on the dark room.<BR>
  I could enjoy to make this machine. If you are tired to make radios, make TV!<BR>

  I also made oscilloscope TV like you, but I used 4 resistor (1k,2k,4k,8k) based 
  DAC to modulate the beam - I mean pulse modulation for 16 shades of gray intensity. 
  It was disappointing, because the brightness of the oscilloscope tube is not 
  good to watch during the day! What do you think about my projects? If you want 
  to make them, you can also put them on your home-page - I will be very happy! 
  As I said, it was almost 20 years ago, when I did it, so I do not have the original 
  diagrams. The three major components were CMOS Hexadecimal Buffered Counter 
  with build-in clock (500khz), 4 x resistors connected to buffers, and Voltage 
  Comparator. The principal was very easy - counter starts counting clock impulses 
  and as soon as the voltage coming from the receiver is equal to the voltage, 
  produced by the resistors, comparator sends reset to buffers, and everything 
  starts again from the beginning. The output of the counter was also fed to the 
  PCM modulator of the Z input of my oscilloscope.<BR>
